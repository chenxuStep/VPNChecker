Ethics and Privacy: 
The offline dataset in this paper is derived from the real world. To mitigate potential privacy and ethical risks, our ISP partner anonymizes all client IPs and provides us only with traffic logs, including ports, IPs, and domains. 
While it's true that any detection technology harbors the potential for misuse, the innovations detailed in this paper can also help the privacy community better understand network behaviors, thereby empowering efforts to safeguard user data against breaches. 
Any data we obtain from the detection engine is only used for evaluation purposes. Given our limited dataset, the result may not fully represent the actual capabilities of these detection engines, and our purpose is not to distinguish which is the best.
